Functionality -- I implemented "crack", with command line interface succcessfully implemented.

Object Oriented Programming -- I implemented 7 classes with a superclass, and two modules, one of which is reusable (the one for file IO). All classes are less than 100 lines, and all methods are less than 8, with a couple exceptions--there were times when I separated out variables for the sake of clarity. I could have made these methods less than 8, but chose clarity instead. Three methods self-initialize using class methods.

Test Driven Development -- Testing is at 100% with clear test names. I used TDD pretty strictly, with one exception. When I was implementing the crack class, I did a lot of "doodling" in code trying to figure out how to handle this method. It was not possible for me to write tests beforehand for some of this, but it was thoroughly tested after the fact. I hope you'll give me a pass for this.

Version Control -- I had 77 commits and 16 pull request, all are clearly labeled, except for a few in which minor refactoring and cleanup was done.

I believe I should get a 4 or close to a 4 in all of the above categories. I feel the only places I might have fallen short are as follows:

I developed this projet pretty strictly from lower levels to high, so there was no opportunity to use mocks and stubs--the methods I needed already existed in all cases. Also, I used a couple of one letter variable names in places where I thought they would be clear and the code was starting to look really unwieldy when I used names that were more descriptive.

Thanks! Will.
